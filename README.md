# CYOA (Cat Your Own Adventure)
A text based 'choose your own adventure' game to test out my C# knowledge

This was a fun way to try out my initial coding skills and learning to use libraries for the first time, but after learning more I now know this could be done a lot better. 
Maybe at some point I will revisit the idea and re-write the code.
